Welcome to my profile! I come from Switzerland and have been living in Heidelberg since August 2020. I studied German and Italian at the University of Basel and completed my Master's degree in multidisciplinary translation in Brussels. Previously, I worked as a project manager in the translation industry and also freelanced for the Flossenbürg concentration camp memorial site, transcribing French interviews of concentration camp survivors.

Since deciding to switch careers, I’ve gained extensive experience in programming. After completing a bootcamp in web development, I pursued further education in TypeScript and Angular, and secured my first role as a Frontend Developer. Currently, I am enhancing my skills in Python, C#, Ionic, and Capacitor through additional training.

I’m passionate about continuing to grow in the tech industry and am excited to apply my skills to new challenges.

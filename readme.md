Welcome to my profile! I come from Switzerland and I have been leaving in Heidelberg since August 2020. I studied German and Italian at the University of Basel and completed my Master's degree in multidisciplinary translation in Brussels. I have previously worked as a project manager in the translation industry. I also work freelance for the Flossenb√ºrg concentration camp memorial site, transcribing French interviews of concentration camp survivors. For some time now, I have decided to change my career and would like to enter the IT industry. That's why I'm currently doing a bootcamp in web development.
